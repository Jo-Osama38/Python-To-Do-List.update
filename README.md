# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game – Improved Version (Python)

This project is an **enhanced and improved version** of a Tic Tac Toe game I previously built.
The goal of this version was to **refactor the code**, apply **better OOP practices**, and add
advanced features like **AI using Minimax**, multiple board sizes, and a cleaner game structure.
